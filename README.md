# Ezekiel-Final-Project

This project is a simple yet dynamic travel-themed website showcasing various popular tourist destinations in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. It aims to provide users with a visually immersive and informative platform.

Features:
The website uses a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a smooth and interactive experience. The CSS includes a responsive design with a fixed navigation bar at the top, hover effects for images and cards, and smooth scrolling transitions for sections. The layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes using flexbox. The JavaScript provides interactivity with functions like handleScroll(), which adds an animation class to images when they come into view as the user scrolls, and flipit() through flipit11(), which dynamically changes images and their descriptions when clicked, showcasing personal travel stories. The changeImage(direction) function allows users to cycle through a set of images, creating a looping gallery effect. Additionally, the website integrates social media links in the footer using Font Awesome icons.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: Structure of the webpage.
CSS3: Styling, including flexbox for layout and animations for interactions.
JavaScript: For interactivity, including image hover effects, dynamic content change, and smooth scrolling.
Font Awesome: For social media icons in the footer.
